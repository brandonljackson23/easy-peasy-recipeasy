# project3

## FOR DEVELOPMENT

After you clone the repo do npm install in the root directory it will CD into Server and Client and run npm i.

If any files are missing feel free to add them.

If any files have code that we don't need in feel free to remove it. I just added some starter code to give us an idea of where to go and how it "MIGHT" look.

Everyone remember to make their own branch so we don't get merge conflicts lets, always pull from master and merge to your branch locally. then when you push back to the repo, push to your branch and merge through github in pull requests. That should help us avoid any issues. I am going to just name my branch my name to keep it simple.
